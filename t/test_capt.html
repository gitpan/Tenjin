<?pl start_capture('captured_part'); ?>
<?pl	if ($scalar_variable) { ?>
[== $scalar_variable =]
<?pl	} else { ?>
I don't have a scalar variable.
<?pl	}
	if ($sclasaqwera_variable) { ?>
[== $sclasaqwera_variable =]
<?pl	} else { ?>
I don't have a sclasaqwera_variable.
<?pl	} ?>
<?pl stop_capture(); ?>
I captured the following output:
[== $context->{captured_part} =]

Now I'll do the same as the beginning, but with placeholder:
<?pl start_placeholder('scalar_variable'); ?>
I don't have a scalar variable.
<?pl stop_placeholder(); ?>

<?pl start_placeholder('scalaasdfr_variable'); ?>
I don't have a scalasdfar variable.
<?pl stop_placeholder(); ?>

Just for fun I'm gonna echo something:
<?pl echo("something..."); ?>
