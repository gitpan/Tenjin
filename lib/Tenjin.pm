=head1 NAME

Tenjin - Fast templating engine with support for embedded Perl.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Tenjin;

	$Tenjin::USE_STRICT = 1;	# use strict in the embedded Perl inside
					# your templates. Recommended, but not used
					# by default.

	$Tenjin::ENCODING = "utf8";	# set the encoding of your template files
					# to utf8. This is the default encoding used
					# so there's no need to do this if your
					# templates really are utf8.

	my $engine = Tenjin->new(\%options);
	my $context = { title => 'Tenjin Example', items => [qw/AAA BBB CCC/] };
	my $filename = 'file.html';
	my $output = $engine->render($filename, $context);
	print $output;

=head1 VERSION

0.05

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tenjin is a very fast and full-featured templating engine, implemented in several programming languages, among them Perl.

The Perl version of Tenjin supports embedded Perl code, nestable layout template,
inclusion of other templates inside a template, capturing parts of or the entire
template output, file and memory caching, template arguments and preprocessing.

The original version of Tenjin is developed by Makoto Kuwata. This CPAN
version is developed by Ido Perlmuter and differs from the original in a
few key aspects:

=over

=item * Code is entirely revised, packages are separated into modules, with
a smaller number of packages than the original version. In particular, the
Tenjin::Engine module no longer exists, and is now instead just the Tenjin
module (i.e. this one).

=item * Support for rendering templates from non-files sources (such as
a database) is added.

=item * Ability to set the encoding of your templates is added.

=item * HTML is encoded and decoded using the L<HTML::Entities> module,
instead of internally.

=item * The C<pltenjin> script is not provided, at least for now.

=back

To make it clear, this version of Tenjin might somehow divert from the
original Tenjin's roadmap. Although my aim is to be as compatible as
possible (and this version is always updated with features and changes
from the original), I cannot guarantee it. Please note that version 0.05
of this module is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new \%options

This creates a new instant of Tenjin. C<\%options> is a hash-ref
containing Tenjin's configuration options:

=over

=item * B<path> - Array-ref of filesystem paths where templates will be searched

=item * B<prefix> - A string that will be automatically prepended to template names
		 when searching for them in the path. Empty by default.

=item * B<postfix> - The default extension to be automtically appended to template names
		  when searching for them in the path. Don't forget to include the
		  dot, such as '.html'. Empty by default.

=item * B<cache> - If set to 1 (the default), compiled templates will be cached on the
		filesystem.

=item * B<preprocess> - Enable template preprocessing (turned off by default). Only
		     use if you're actually using any preprocessed Perl code in
		     your templates.

=item * B<layout> - Name of a layout template that can be optionally used. If set,
		 templates will be automatically inserted into the layout template,
		 in the location where you use C<[== $_content ==]>.

=item * B<strict> - Another way to make Tenjin use strict on embedded Perl code (turned
		 off by default).

=item * B<encoding> - Another way to set the encoding of your template files (set to utf8
		   by default).

=back

=head2 render( $tmpl_name, [\%context, $layout] )

Renders a template whose name is identified by C<$tmpl_name>. Remember that a prefix
and a postfix might be added if they where set when creating the Tenjin instance.

C<$context> is a hash-ref containing the variables that will be available for usage inside
the templates. So, for example, if your C<\%context> is { message => 'Hi there }, then
you can use C<$message> inside your templates.

C<$layout> is a flag denoting whether or not to render this template into the layout template
there was set when creating the Tenjin instance.

Please note that file templates are cached on disk (with a '.cache') extension.
Tenjin automatically deprecates these cache files every 10 seconds. If you
find this value is too low, you can override the C<$Tenjin::TIMESTAMP_INTERVAL>
variable with your preferred value.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The original Tenjin website is located at L<http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/>. In there check out
L<http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/pltenjin-users-guide.html> for detailed usage guide,
L<http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/pltenjin-examples.html> for examples, and
L<http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/pltenjin-faq.html> for frequently asked questions.

Note that the Perl version of Tenjin is refered to as plTenjin on the Tenjin website,
and that, as oppose to this module, the website suggests using a .plhtml extension
for the templates instead of .html (this is entirely your choice).

L<Tenjin::Template>, L<Catalyst::View::Tenjin>.

=head1 CHANGES

This version of Tenjin breaks backwards compatibility with previous versions.
In particular, the Tenjin::Engine module does not exist any more and is
instead integrated into this one. Templates are also rendered entirely
different (as per changes in the original tenjin) which provides much
faster rendering.

Upon upgrading to this version, you MUST perform the following changes
for your applications (or, if you're using Catalyst, you must also upgrade
L<Catalyst::View::Tenjin>):

=over

=item * C<use Tenjin> as your normally would, but to get an instance
of Tenjin you must call C<< Tenjin->new() >> instead of the old method
of calling C<< Tenjin::Engine->new() >>.

=item * Remove all your templates cache files (they are the '.cache' files
in your template directories), they are not compatible with the new
templates structure and WILL cause your application to fail if present.

=back

=head1 TODO

=over

=item * Expand pod documentation and properly document the code, which is
hard to understand as it is.

=item * Create tests, adapted from the tests provided by the original Tenjin.
